Yep ... this is the first blog post for this site where I hope to share some hopefully useful technology related articles.

Another thing is .. I'm trying out Hugo - the static site generator. This site is created off Hugo.

I think, for a tech blog, Hugo is a great solution. It's easy. It allows a lot of flexibility and tweaking oppurtunities which is awesome! It's also simple and very functional. 

So .. hop on the ride .. and let's see if I can come up with some useful stuff to share.


Thanks.
Rommel
